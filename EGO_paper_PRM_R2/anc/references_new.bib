abstract="In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.",

    abstract = { We consider a Bayesian ranking and selection problem with independent normal rewards and a correlated multivariate normal belief on the mean values of these rewards. Because this formulation of the ranking and selection problem models dependence between alternatives' mean values, algorithms may use this dependence to perform efficiently even when the number of alternatives is very large. We propose a fully sequential sampling policy called the knowledge-gradient policy, which is provably optimal in some special cases and has bounded suboptimality in all others. We then demonstrate how this policy may be applied to efficiently maximize a continuous function on a continuous domain while constrained to a fixed number of noisy measurements. }

Both are problematic when it comes to experimental design purposes in the laboratory. The first approach requires a comprehensive knowledge of the parameters involved in all biological processes a priori, whereas the results from the second method may not have a biological correspondence and thus cannot be tested in the laboratory. Moreover, the current methods cannot readily utilize existing curated knowledge databases and do not consider uncertainty in the knowledge. Therefore, a new methodology is needed that can generate a dynamical model based on available biological data, assuming uncertainty, while the results from experimental design can be examined in the laboratory.",

   abstract = {In a wide variety of engineering applications, the mathematical model cannot be fully identified. Therefore, one would like to construct robust operators (filters, classifiers, controllers etc.) that perform optimally relative to incomplete knowledge. Improving model identification through determining unknown parameters can enhance the performance of robust operators. One would like to perform the experiment that provides the most information relative to the engineering objective. The authors present an experimental design framework for parameter estimation in signal processing when the random process model is in the form of canonical expansions. The proposed experimental design is based on the concept of the mean objective cost of uncertainty, which quantifies model uncertainty by taking into account the performance degradation of the designed operator owing to the presence of uncertainty. They provide the general framework for experimental design in the context of canonical expansions and solve it for two major signal processing problems: optimal linear filtering and signal detection.},

Beginning with a base compound, we consider the problem of searching for a chemical derivative of the molecule that best treats a given disease. The problem of choosing molecules to test to maximize the expected quality of the best compound discovered may be formulated mathematically as a ranking-and-selection problem in which each molecule is an alternative. We apply a recently developed algorithm, known as the knowledge-gradient algorithm, that uses correlations in our Bayesian prior distribution between the performance of different alternatives (molecules) to dramatically reduce the number of molecular tests required, but it has heavy computational requirements that limit the number of possible alternatives to a few thousand. We develop computational improvements that allow the knowledge-gradient method to consider much larger sets of alternatives, and we demonstrate the method on a problem with 87,120 alternatives. }

Our estimation approach aggregates over a set of kernel functions in order to achieve a more consistent estimator. Each element in the kernel estimation set uses a different bandwidth to achieve better aggregation. The final estimate uses a weighting scheme with the inverse mean square errors of the kernel estimators as weights. This weighting scheme is shown to be optimal under independent kernel estimators. For choosing the measurement, we employ the knowledge gradient policy that relies on predictive distributions to calculate the optimal sampling point. Our method allows a setting where the beliefs are expected to be correlated but the correlation structure is unknown beforehand. Moreover, the proposed policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal.",

abstract="Module identification has been studied extensively in order to gain deeper understanding of complex systems, such as social networks as well as biological networks. Modules are often defined as groups of vertices in these networks that are topologically cohesive with similar interaction patterns with the rest of the vertices. Most of the existing module identification algorithms assume that the given networks are faithfully measured without errors. However, in many real-world applications, for example, when analyzing protein-protein interaction networks from high-throughput profiling techniques, there is significant noise with both false positive and missing links between vertices. In this paper, we propose a new model for more robust module identification by taking advantage of multiple observed networks with significant noise so that signals in multiple networks can be strengthened and help improve the solution quality by combining information from various sources.",

abstract="Phenotypic classification is problematic because small samples are ubiquitous; and, for these, use of prior knowledge is critical. If knowledge concerning the feature-label distribution -- for instance, genetic pathways -- is available, then it can be used in learning. Optimal Bayesian classification provides optimal classification under model uncertainty. It differs from classical Bayesian methods in which a classification model is assumed and prior distributions are placed on model parameters. With optimal Bayesian classification, uncertainty is treated directly on the feature-label distribution, which assures full utilization of prior knowledge and is guaranteed to outperform classical methods.",
